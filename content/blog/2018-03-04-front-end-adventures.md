## Front end holy war!

I've been focusing more on the front-end of things lately and I figured I'd jot down some notes as to how I came to choose the tools I'm using.
I started out assuming that Vue.js would be a good choice as it seems to be so heavily used by a lot of Rails developers I admire like [Chris Oliver](http://excid3.com/ "Chris Oliver's homepage") but I had a difficult time with it.
<br>
Vue allows you to develop 'Templates' within a component that are structured like HTML but use Vue specific keywords to do some heavy lifting for you. If you take the time to learn Vue's keywords and structure you can probably build apps pretty quickly. Alas, I didn't find it as intuitive as I keep reading about.
<br>
My criteria for all tools I choose are as follows:
<br>
1. Community - A healthy and supportive community of developers and resources.
<br>
2. Documentation - Clear, well-written guides preferably from the developers of the tools themselves.
<br>
3. Productivity - I stick with the tools I find myself most productive in. 
<br>
<br>
No. 3 is ultimately been my driving choice. It's why I stuck with Rails and why I've now chosen React for the frontend.
Why React? Well, it's, as the saying goes, just javascript afterall and I'm comfortable with JS these days. Once you've grasped what state is and how to manage it I think that React makes developing the front end a lot nicer. Creating a component-based display allows you to break-down a complex app into manageable bite-size pieces!

You can check out my first big react project at [Tarot-React](https://tarot-react.howlcode.com "Reactive Tarot"). I built a pure Rails 5 API to serve up JSON for the rider-waite tarot deck complete with images and full-meanings of the cards. The React frontend will showcase the cards in different spreads and allow users to simulate a real-life 'reading'.
<br>
I can heartily reccomend the official [React-Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html "Hello world tutorial") if you want to dip your toes into the React world!
